My name is Nikita Yatchenko and I am passionate about mathematics and machine learning. My interest in these disciplines can be summarized as applying abstract mathematical thinking to dissect complex problems into meaningful insights. I am curious about novel technology that helps me uncover my potential in this interest.

With this blog it is my goal to record my journey as I grow as data scientist. This will primarily be a record of the projects that I complete and insights that I ahve gathered from them.
