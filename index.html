Hello, my name is Nikita Yatchenko! I am fascinated by the beauty of mathematics and I am passionate about applying its abstract ideas to understand this world, building 
data products that enhance our lives, and learning. This blog is my journey in the exciting world of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to post
anything I find interesting: my projects, technical notes, and intuition. My ambition is to write everything with key intuitions behind every line, every statement.
